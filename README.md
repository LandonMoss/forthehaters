A fun little project where we explore the love-hate relationship with PHP. Ever been roasted for loving PHP too much? Or maybe you've faced skepticism for not being a PHP fan? Fear not, this project is here to give you a chuckle either way!

## How to Use

1. **Answer the Burning Question:** Do you like PHP? Choose between "Yes" or "No" and brace yourself for what's to come!

2. **Get Roasted (or Consoled):** If you select "Yes," prepare for some playful roasting. If you select "No," don't worry, we've got a virtual shoulder for you to cry on.
